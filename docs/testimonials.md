# Testimonials

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) has used Ajv for validating our complex configurations. Ajv has proven to be reliable over the years we’ve been using it and ESLint is proud to sponsor Ajv’s continued development.

I always thought that built-in data validation is a key feature of any web framework. We decided to leverage JSON Schema in [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io), and Ajv fits our needs wonderfully: it’s fast, stable and well maintained.

Ajv has become a centerpiece of all data-validation logic in my open-source projects and businesses. It is spec-compliant, extensible, fast and has amazing support.
