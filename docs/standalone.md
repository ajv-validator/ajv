# Standalone validation code

[[toc]]

Ajv supports generating standalone modules with exported validation function(s), with one default export or multiple named exports, that are pre-compiled and can be used without Ajv. It is useful for several reasons:

- to reduce the browser bundle size - Ajv is not included in the bundle (although if you have a large number of schemas the bundle can become bigger - when the total size of generated validation code is bigger than Ajv code).
- to reduce the start-up time - the validation and compilation of schemas will happen during build time.
- to avoid dynamic code evaluation with Function constructor (used for schema compilation) - when it is prohibited by the browser page [Content Security Policy](./security.md#content-security-policy).

This functionality in Ajv v7 supersedes deprecated package ajv-pack that can be used with Ajv v6. All schemas, including those with recursive references, formats and user-defined keywords are supported, with few [limitations](#configuration-and-limitations).

## Usage with CLI

In most cases you would use this functionality via [ajv-cli](https://github.com/jessedc/ajv-cli) (>= 4.0.0) to generate module that exports validation function.

```sh
npm install -g ajv-cli
ajv compile -s schema.json -o validate_schema.js
```

`validate_schema.js` will contain the module exporting validation function that can be bundled into your application.

See [ajv-cli](https://github.com/jessedc/ajv-cli) docs for additional information.

## Usage from code

```sh
npm install ajv
```

```javascript
const Ajv = require("ajv") // version >= v7.0.0
const ajv = new Ajv({code: {source: true}}) // this option is required to generate standalone code
const standaloneCode = require("ajv/dist/standalone").default

const schema = {
  $id: "https://example.com/object.json",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    foo: {
      type: "string",
      pattern: "^[a-z]+$",
    },
  },
}

// 1. generate module with a single default export (CommonJS and ESM compatible):
const validate = ajv.compile(schema)
let moduleCode = standaloneCode(ajv, validate)

// 2. pass map of schema IDs to generate multiple exports,
// it avoids code duplication if schemas are mutually recursive or have some share elements:
let moduleCode = standaloneCode(ajv, {
  validateObject: "https://example.com/object.json",
})

// 3. or generate module with all schemas added to the instance (excluding meta-schemas),
// export names would use schema IDs (or keys passed to addSchema method):
let moduleCode = standaloneCode(ajv)

// now you can
// write module code to file
const fs = require("fs")
const path = require("path")
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "/validate.js"), moduleCode)

// ... or require module from string
const requireFromString = require("require-from-string")
const standaloneValidate = requireFromString(moduleCode) // for a single default export
```

Ajv package should still be a run-time dependency for most schemas, but generated modules can only depend on code in [runtime](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/tree/master/lib/runtime) folder, so the whole Ajv will not be included in the bundle (or executed) if you require the modules with standalone validation code from your application code.

## Configuration and limitations

To support standalone code generation:

- Ajv option `source.code` must be set to `true`
- only `code` and `macro` user-defined keywords are supported (see [User defined keywords](./keywords.md)).
- when `code` keywords define variables in shared scope using `gen.scopeValue`, they must provide `code` property with the code snippet. See source code of pre-defined keywords for examples in [vocabularies folder](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/vocabularies).
- if formats are used in standalone code, ajv option `code.formats` should contain the code snippet that will evaluate to an object with all used format definitions - it can be a call to `require("...")` with the correct path (relative to the location of saved module):

```javascript
import myFormats from "./my-formats"
import Ajv, {_} from "ajv"
const ajv = new Ajv({
  formats: myFormats,
  code: {
    source: true,
    formats: _`require("./my-formats")`,
  },
})
```

If you only use formats from [ajv-formats](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats) this option will be set by this package automatically.
